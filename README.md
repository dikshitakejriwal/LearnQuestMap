# LearnQuest Map


I absolutely love learning, but it is often difficult to find the best way to learn something. So, I created this webapp "LearnQuest Map," which will help learners like me find the best way to learn something and make use of their time efficiently. It is built using Next.js, a React framework.

The app also leverages the OpenAI API, which provides intelligent suggestions to tailor your study plan based on your input. Whether you're aiming to master Python, become a data scientist, or dive into any other subject, "LearnQuest Map" is designed to plot out an optimized path for your educational journey.

By simply entering the subject you wish to learn, the number of hours you can commit per week, your preferred learning resources (videos, webpages, practice exercises), and your ultimate learning goal, "LearnQuest Map" concocts a study plan that's just right for you.

Try it yourself and Enjoy Learning!
